## üìä Project Overview

This interactive dashboard provides a 360-degree view of an insurance portfolio's claims activity. By dissecting claims across various dimensions like demographics, vehicle attributes, and driver behavior, it helps answer critical business questions:
*   Who is most likely to file a claim?
*   What types of vehicles are associated with higher risk?
*   How do driving history and annual mileage impact claims frequency?

**Key Business Value:** Identify high-risk customer segments and vehicle profiles to refine underwriting policies, optimize premium pricing, and improve loss ratios.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

*   **BI Platform:** Microsoft Power BI
*   **Data Processing:** Power Query
*   **Visualization:** Interactive Charts and KPI Cards
*   **Analysis:** DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
